#  WebRays - Ray Tracing on the Web

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.8.0-blue)

The goal of WebRays is to offer a flexible and easy-to-use programming interface for robust and high-performance ray intersection tests on modern browsers. The core library is developed in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly. Although the main target of webrays is the Web, it can also be compiled and used as a native library on desktop platforms.
